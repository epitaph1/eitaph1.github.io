	<h3>About me</h3>
        <p1 style="font-family:verdana;">Hello! My name is Jaymehn Z.B. Rita, but some people call me Jaym or Jamie. I'm a beginner in coding.<br>I hope to become an expert that can make a living off of this skill. I enjoy videogames, TTRPGs, plants, and writing.<br>I was born on Oahu, then lived in California, then North Carolina, South Carolina, and moved back again. I try to do my best.</p>

	<img src="IMG_1167.JPG" alt="jzbr" style="float:left;transform:rotate(90deg);width:300;height:200px;border:30px;">
		<!–– Images are a pain. This image took so long to implement. At first it was sideways. First time I rotated it, a second, larger picture appeared under it. Finally, I learned the coorect way to rotate. ––>

	<p1 style="font-family:verdana;">In particular for coding I want to go into software development, or video game development. Maybe I could even specialize in software development by creating software to help in my other interests, like analyzing botanical data, or a character management application. Video games are particularly interesting to me. I grew up playing them and eventually I started wanting to actually make them. Make my own worlds, my perfect movement shooter, stuff like that. It seems like a great creative medium.</p1>
